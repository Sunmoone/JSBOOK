<p>
	Node.prefix

prefix returns the namespace prefix of the specified node, or null if no prefix is specified. This property is read only.

Syntax

string = element.prefix
Examples

The following alerts "x".

&ltx:div onclick="alert(this.prefix)"/>
Notes

This will only work when a namespace-aware parser is used, i.e. when a document is served with an XML mime-type. This will not work for HTML documents.
